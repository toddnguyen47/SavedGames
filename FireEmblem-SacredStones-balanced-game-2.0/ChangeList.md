# Balanced Game 2.0

I'm not too fond of how the original Sacred Stones determined the maximum stats of its classes,
so I'll do my best to readjust them here. Note that this is my personal opinion.

# Change List

## Classes

- Ephraim Great Lord
  - Max STR/MAG: 27 → 28
  - Max SKL: 26 → 28
  - Max SPD: 24 → 27
  - **EXPLANATION:** Ephraim has insane Growth rates, sporting 55/55/45 in STR/SKL/SPD, respectively.
    His class does NOT do his growth rates justice. On average (courtery of [serenesforest](https://serenesforest.net/the-sacred-stones/characters/average-stats/ephraim/) ), Ephraim will max out his STR at 20/16,
    his SKL at 20/11, and his SPD at 20/10. That's a little bit sad, in my opinion. Thus, I increased
    his max stats to better reflect his growth rates. His STR is increased by 1 so he should be
    maxing that out near 20/19 or 20/20, his SKL increased by 2 which he should max around 20/15,
    and his SPD is increased by 3 so he can max it around 20/15, as well. I feel like those levels
    should reflect where his stats should be maxed, instead of it nearing maxing out only at 20/10.
- General
  - Can no longer use swords.
  - Axe starting level: E → D
  - **EXPLANATION:** If they are tanky, have Great Shield (even though it does not activate often), and have
    excellent max stats, they should not control over the Weapon triangle as well, 5 movement speed
    be damned.
- Paladin
  - Max SKL: (M) 26 → 27, (F) 27 → 28
  - Max RES: (M) 25 → 26, (F) 26 → 27
  - **EXPLANATION:** Unpopular opinion, but I think the Paladin is outclassed by the Great Knight /
    General in this game. Perhaps it's because I play the game slowly that I think so... Anyhow, I made
    sure that the Paladin's Max SKL is at least equal to the General's Max SKL, and giving Paladins
    1 more RES so that it is the only stat other than SKL that the Paladin beats Great Knight /
    Generals at.
- Ranger
  - Max STR: (F) 23 → 24
  - Max SKL: (F) 28 → 29
  - Gains ability to use Shamshir.
  - **EXPLANATION:** Equality! Female Rangers lost 2 points of max STR for NO reason, so I reallocated
    those 2 points here. As for Shamshir... that's just for fun. I wanted Eirika to have an option to
    promote into a Ranger, and
    she can use Shamshir so I thought, why not. In FE7 Rangers and Myrmidons both come from Sacae
    anyway (go Lyn!!!). Honestly Killing Edge is a better Shamshir anyway, and any sword classes
    can use Killing Edge so, this isn't game breaking or anything.
- Sniper
  - Gains +15% Crit skill.
  - **EXPLANATION:** Face it, Ranger beats Sniper in every single sense of the word. Giving the
    Sniper +15% Crit can hopefully give this class the extra oomph it needs to balance out the
    Ranger's superior max stats and ability to use swords.
- Wight
  - Max STR: 24 → 28
  - Max SPD: 26 → 28
  - Max DEF: 22 → 23
  - **EXPLANATION:** Another for fun stats, I wanted Ephraim of all things to be able to promote
    into a Wight. I made the Wight's Max stats similar to Ephraim's Great Lord adjusted max stats.
    This way, Great Lord has -1 max SPD but +1 Movement (7 MOV compared to Wight's 6). Of course,
    Wights also have the ability to wield Swords (including the Shamshir!). You can decide
    which class you want Ephraim to gear towards.

## Promotions

- Eirika can now choose to promote to Ranger in addition to her Great Lord class
  - **EXPLANATION:** Nothing here, just for fun and giggles. I have always liked it when main
    Lords are in a class that isn't unique to them.
- Ephraim can now choose to promote to Wight in addition to her Great Lord class
  - **EXPLANATION:** Again, fun and giggles. Wight has +1 Max SPD and the ability to wield swords, but
    they have -1 MOV since they aren't mounted. Your choice!
